A breadth-first graph search implementation written in Python.

This function will find the shortest path between two vertices in a graph.

The path is tracked using a queue.

The function takes 3 parameters:

* graph: the graph we are searching
* start_vertex: the vertex we are starting the search on
* target_value: the value we are searching the graph for
